                <p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.</p>

                <h2>Why you should choose Better Professor App</h2>
                <div class="reasonOne">
                    <p>It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Let your heart be your guide.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reasonTwo">
                    <p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reasonThree">
                    <p>Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Brown is such a nice color. We have a fantastic little sky! I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.</p>
