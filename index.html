                <p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.</p>

                    <h3>Reason One</h3>
                    <p>It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Let your heart be your guide.</p>

                    <p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth.</p>

                    <p>Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Brown is such a nice color. We have a fantastic little sky! I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.</p>

                    <p>You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Zip. That easy. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Just make little strokes like that.</p>
