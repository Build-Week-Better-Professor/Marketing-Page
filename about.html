                <p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.</p>

                <div class="personOne">
                    <p>Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Those great big fluffy clouds. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.</p>

                <div class="personTwo">
                    <p>Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="personThree">
                    <p>Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Only eight colors that you need. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="personFour">
                    <p>You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Let your heart be your guide. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?</p>
